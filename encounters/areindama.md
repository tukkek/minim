# Areindama encounter-tables
This document presents over-10 tables. each with 5 units to be used for generating encounters, with 90 units in total. Areindama's theme is a post-apocalyptic future with a focus on vehicular-combat but it can be adapted to a wide-range of science-fiction scenarios.

The tables are presented top-bottom as most-least challenging so that rolling two ten-sided dice and picking the highest or lowest result may be used as a strategy to incentivize certain-results rather than a single die. A roll of 6 on a six-sided die is intentionally left-empty to be rerolled on other table.
