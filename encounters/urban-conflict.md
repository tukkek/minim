# Urban-conflict encounters
This document presents 4 tables to be used for generating encounters, with over-50 units in-total. The theme is information-age urban war-fare, including combat-vehicles; drones; and near-future units such as robots. These can be easily adapted to other settings such as historical wars or the post-apocalypse.

The tables are presented top-bottom as most-least challenging so that rolling two-dice and picking the highest or lowest result may be used as a strategy to incentivize certain-results rather than a single die.
