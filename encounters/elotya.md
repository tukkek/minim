# Elotya encounter-tables
This document presents over-30 tables. each with 5 units to be used for generating encounters. Elotya's theme is a low-magic fantasy scenario featuring early fire-arms but it can be adapted to a wide-range of scenarios from steam-punk to the historical early-modern era such as napoleonic and revolutionary-wars.

The tables are presented top-bottom as most-least challenging so that rolling two ten-sided dice and picking the highest or lowest result may be used as a strategy to incentivize certain-results rather than a single die. A roll of 6 on a six-sided die is intentionally left-empty to be rerolled on other table.
