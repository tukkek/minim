# Minim 
`Alex Henry, 2025-09-14`.

Minim is a role-playing game system that is simple to learn and play! RPGs are free; fun; and can be played by people of all-ages! They also promote problem-solving; creativity; team-work and story-telling, even being-used as an education-aide!

> Table-top role-playing games are a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which each person playing the game will make-believe that he or she is a character in the game. A person playing the game will tell the action of his character and a system of rules will tell whether the action can be done or not. The game will happen in a made-up world that is controlled by another person playing the game, called a game-master. The game-master tells the game's story to the players, tells them where they are in the game world and plays the part of all the nonplayer-characters (NPCs) and foes that the players meet.

You can find more information; premade-scenarios; manuals; and other-products in many book-stores; libraries; and on-line!

The traditional quantity of players for a game-session is a narrator plus 2 to 5 players; and it may last from a couple to several hours. Stories can be self-contained adventures for one-session; or years-long affairs featuring recurring player-characters!

# Why rules?
You may be wondering *this game seems more-like group story-telling, why should I bother with rules*? They come-in to prevent what happens when children play: *I shoot you! No, you miss! No, I got you, you're dead! No, I'm not*!

Minim's rules also help the narrator prepare interesting; fair situations for his players. A game that is too easy or hard can quickly become unfun. Rules can't substitute a narrator who knows his-players best but they can surely help!

That being-said players don't need to constantly-rely on the rules! If the game goes-well with few-rules, that's fine and they are still-available for when they are required; are valuable; or can lead-to interesting-situations. Each game has its own sweet-spot!

The Golden-rule of RPGs states that the narrator always has the final-say on any decision even if it goes against the rules! Remember also that the game is meant to be fun for all-involved, whatever *fun* may mean for any particular player-group! 

# Philosophy
Minim is short for _minimalistic_. The system tries to be a very-simple game that can be-played using only common six-sided dice, ideally 2 per-player. Miniatures; extra-dice and a drawing-paper or white-board can be used but are entirely optional! The system is easy to learn as you read this short-book and new-rules are easy to create if they aren't described here.

Being simple, it's also easy to convert existing characters; adventures; worlds; and concepts to Minim or create new-ones, even mid-game if the narrator likes improvising! Many popular-systems require ample-preparation but Minim's is minimal.

To keep rules simple and short unfortunately some-realism has to be discarded. This doesn't mean that Minim is a casual-game though, combat can be highly-tactical and lethal especially when there are many-enemies against the players!

This is also a generic-system, which means that it supports all play-styles from swash-buckling pirate-adventures; to medieval-fantasy; or science-fiction worlds using the exact-same rules. You can even mix them a bit if you'd like to try!

Minim's utmost-focus is to create fast-flowing narratives and rich game-play scenarios while balancing simplicity with realism.

# Tests
To determine the result of actions choose the most-relevant trait and skill. Apply +1 to the trait-score if the character has that skill or a -1 if he doesn’t, if there is no clear relevant-skill use only the trait (±0). This number will be the test’s **target**.

Now roll 2-dice and for-each determine the **partial-results** by examining each-roll:
-   If the roll is a 1; or lower than the target then you have a **success** (+1)
-   If the dice roll is the same as the target, you have a **neutral** result (±0)
-   Otherwise a 6; or a roll higher-than the target  is a  **failure** (-1)

Add the first and second partial-results to get the attempted action’s **out-come**. The possibilities are:
* **+2, critical-success**, the action surpasses-expectations, enhancing its benefits or achieving-them faster
* **+1, success**, the action achieves its intended-result
* **0, neutral**, partial-success or a slightly positive or negative result; unintended result; may-benefit the next-attempt...
**-1, failure**, no immediate-result but retrying is usually-possible
**-2, critical-failure**, the exact-opposite of the intended-result; disaster; danger; a total and final failure...

Examples:
* A warrior swings its sword at an opponent. With 3-brawl and possessing the fight-skill the target is 4 (3 + 1). He rolls a 3 and a 4. 3 is less than 4 so it’s a success (+1); and 4 equals 4 so it’s neutral (±0). The out-come is +1, a success!
* Now an over-weight priest tries the same. His brawl is only 2 and he lacks the fight-skill so the target is 1 (2 - 1). He rolls 1 and 5. 5 is higher than 1 so it’s a failure (-1) but a natural-1 is an automatic-success (+1)! The out-come is neutral, 0 (1 - 1). The enemy wasn’t hit but perhaps moved-back to dodge-it, earning the priest just-enough time to escape to safety!

## Bonuses and penalties
Often you'll find that in-game circumstances will make actions easier or harder like trying to run with your legs tied-up!Bonuses and penalties can be:
-   +2 to the target for big-advantages
-   +1 to the target for small-advantages 
-   -1 to the target for small-disadvantages
-   -2 to the target for big-disadvantages
    
Multiple bonuses or penalties can-apply to an action. Sum all applicable bonuses and penalties to get a final modifier for the test. For-example: a hero could be trying to strike a monster from the higher-ground (small-advantage); but his sword's tip is broken (small-disadvantage); and the monster is completely-unaware of his-presence (big-advantage).

In a calm environment characters gain a +1 bonus if taking twice as-long performing an action than it would usually-require.

Targets lower-than 1 only achieve successes with rolls of 1 (automatic-success); and 6 (automatic-failures) for targets over-5.

## Collaboration
Many-characters can-attempt to perform the same-action. In this-case each makes their-own test. Usually they test the same trait-skill combination but those may-differ on certain-circumstances. Sum all-results to determine the action's out-come.

For-example a medic; a chemist; and a pathologist try to analyze a blood-sample. The medic tests brain-cure and adds +1; the chemist tests brain-knowledge with a +1 result; the pathologist tests brain-technology with a +0 result. The out-come is +2.

Out-comes higher-than +2 or lower-than -2 are bound to these limits. For very long-term projects like building and launching a space-ship the narrator may define a threshold like +100, with characters slowly-working to that goal over-time.

It's important to distinguish between a characters-group performing actions individually versus performing one-action collaboratively. To hear a distant-sound all-test brass-perception and those individual-tests determines who heard the sound or not. Now if they are coordinating a house-search for evidence of a crime that is one-action with one out-come.

# Characters
Each player-character starts with one-trait at 4, other at 3; and a last-one at 2. They can then acquire 3-skills of the highest-trait; 2-skills of the middle-one; and a skill of the lowest. They also distribute 4-points to powers.

These are normal starting-characters which are average-inhabitants of the game-world. Stronger or weaker player-characters can be made if the narrator so-chooses by applying a +1 or -1 to all-traits.

Narrator-characters can be made with the values the narrator judges-appropriate. He should not be spending-points but rather assigning values and skills that properly-represent that character’s abilities. A mighty-villain will naturally have more-points than the average-person; and animals like dogs and cats will have very-low values.

## Traits
Each character is defined by 3 traits, which are:
* **Brain**  represents the intellectual-prowess of the character
* **Brawl** governs speed; dexterity; precision...
* **Brass** is the presence of a character, ranging from endurance; to mental-fortitude; charm; beauty...

These can have the following scores, with 2 to 4 being the normal-range for player-characters:
* 5, great
* 4, good
* 3, normal
* 2, bad
* 1, terrible

## Skills
Each-trait governs 5 skills. Brain-skills are:
* **Art**, creating things; painting; drawing; stone-work; jewelry; repairs; manufacturing; building; assembling; forgery...
* **Cure**, medicine; healing; first-aid...
* **Knowledge**, wisdom; learning; researching; remembering facts...
* **Security**, lock-picking; burglary; arming and disarming traps and security systems and alarms...
* **Technology**, operating artifacts, from scrolls and magic-items in fantasy to computers and robots in science-fiction...

Brawl-skills:
* **Coordination**, fine motor-skills and manipulation of objects such as calligraphy or playing musical-instruments...
* **Fight**, fighting at close-quarters with a weapon or improvised-weapon or bare-handed; martial arts; grappling...
* **Fire**, using missile-attacks at-range like a fire-arm or bow to hit a far-away target...
* **Sports**, athletics, acrobatics; balance; running; jumping; reaching; dancing; attacking by throwing objects...
* **Stealth**, moving and acting undetected.

Brass-skills:
* **Coercion**, intimidation; bribery; street-smarts; banter...
* **Communication**, oratory; barter; socializing; discovering-rumors; detecting-lies…
* **Perception**, awareness; readiness; acuity; sight; smell; taste; hearing; touch...
* **Steering**, controlling a vehicle or vessel such as a horse; car; ship; plane; space-craft; giant-robot…
* **Survival**, interaction with beasts and critters; riding; farming; zoology; herbalism...

To add realism use specialties that each cost 1-point like heart-surgery and psychotherapy (cure); fencing and karate (fight)...

## Health
Each-character starts at health equal to their brass-score and can never go above-it. Each-time a character is hurt or overly-exerted they receive **fatigue** or **damage** points which are subtracted from the health-score.  A character who loses all their health-points becomes unconscious. A _total-party kill_ happens if all-players lose all their health then the game ends.

Health-points are fully-recovered when characters are able to relax for a-few minutes. Even characters mid-action may take a turn to regain their breath and restore a single fatigue-point if they pass a brass-test.

Narrators running more realistic; serious; or gritty games can treat health less as fatigue and more as permanent-damage. In those cases recovering a health-point requires long-term healing with a +1 for uninterrupted-rest in that period. A medic may also make his-own cure-test;. An extremely-brassy character recovering from 4 points to 5 may only-require a good-night’s sleep but recovering from a debilitating near-death at 1 remaining health-point may require years or months!

Health is not-only physical! In extreme cases psychological and emotional stress can incur health-loss as fatigue-points! This is common for-example in horror-games in-which just glimpsing a terrifying; deadly monstrosity can shatter one's very-sanity!

## Faith
Each player-character starts with a number of  faith-points equal to their brain-score and can never go above-that.  A point can be spent to provide a +1 bonus to an action, once per-action. It represents a character's inner-strength reserves.

Points are regained whenever a character acts according to their **virtue** or **vice**. These characteristics are determined at character-creation, one represents a good, productive quality; the other a negative, twisted personality-flaw. Narrators can award 1 to 3 points per-refill depending on game-style (fantasy-characters regain-faith faster; while they are a rare-resource in grim-dark settings) but also according to how interesting and relevant the action was from a role-playing perspective.

Faith-points are more of a player-character concept. Narrator-characters can-have faith-points but these can be hard to manage individually. Narrators can rather-have an infinite-pool of faith-points; a finite-pool per-scene (usually the sum-total of all narrator-characters brain-scores); or by rolling brain-tests rather than spending-points. Narrator-characters should use faith-points sparingly as these serve as edges that the small players-group have against a much-larger and dangerous world.

## Powers
Unlike skills there is no set-list of powers, each character or category (such as *dragons*) is expected to be unique and feature their-own. There is no-problem of-course in taking-inspiration from preexisting-powers like the Hadouken; Force-abilities; Fire-ball or Ultima spells; or the Round-house Kick and adapting them to fit your tastes! They don't need to be extraordinary, powers like detecting-lies; fast reaction-times and leadership are mundane-abilities as-valuable as any magic-incantation!

Like traits the values for powers range from 1 to 5 but unlike trait-based tests characters use powers by spending a faith-point and rolling a die. If the result is equal or lower than its power-score it is activated; else the action is wasted but the faith-point also isn't-spent. Characters with zero-faith can't use their powers until they regain at least one-point.

There are two intrinsic-powers that all player-characters have, each starting at 1-point for-free:
* **Languages**. each-point grants fluency on a new-language and also a basic-familiarity with all-languages in that language-group. For-example if spending a point to acquire German, you’d also be able to speak English and Dutch at a very-basic level.
* **Wealth** represents a character's finances. Each-point grows wealth exponentially with 1 being very-poor and 5 filthy-rich. Buying items much-cheaper than a character’s wealth-score is free; but buying score-appropriate items require a roll and 1-point is permanently-lost on a success. Points can also be gained during-play if a character acquires valuable-assets!

As a guide-line for balancing a power that targets a single-character should cause 2 points of fatigue; and those that affect all-targets in an area deal 1 point of fatigue. Instead of causing fatigue, powers can also prevent 1 or 2 fatigue; grant ±1 or ±2 bonuses and penalties; or apply-conditions for 1-turn or 2-turns... Other social-based powers like contacts; allies; patrons... should work more like wealth. With the narrator's approval players should decide what their powers can-do based on this.

## Advancement
Many Minim-games are one-shots, meaning that players (or the narrator) create their characters at the start of the game and once it ends the story is also-over. Other games though are **campaigns** creating a longer-story with the same-characters every-game, in this play-style it’s traditional for these characters to grow-stronger over-time. Here’s how it’s done:
* At the end of a game-session the narrator asks players to vote on the coolest role-playing moment and the coolest in-game action, the session's **high-lights**. One faith-point is granted to each of those characters. If the character is already at their maximum-points or if a player receives both-votes he may choose to pass this reward to other-player of his-choosing.
-   **Horizontal-progress.** At the start of each-session players can relocate a single power-point to a new or existing-power. This represents a character’s new-focus or training after last game’s events. It also lets players adjust their-characters until they get them just-right. They can also choose to change their virtue or vice as long as it makes-sense in the story-context.
-   **Gear** is by-far the most-common way that characters increase in power. Finding; buying; or crafting better weapons; magic-wands; armor; tools… offers great game-play and resource-management opportunities for players that scales really-well over longer-periods (a legendary-sword is even-better than a superior-sword)! Many items work exactly like powers with their own power-scores except they can be traded between players or sold. Items can also be expendable (like an invisibility-potion or a grenade) so that players are constantly finding new-toys then using them to get out of bad-situations safely!
-   **Vertical-progress** happens at the end of a major story-arc, usually after a few or several adventures have-occurred and a mile-stone victory has been achieved. Discovering the villain’s secret-weakness may be an entire-story in it-self but usually only actually defeating-him ends the entire story-arc! To celebrate and reward-players on these-occasions the narrator may grant-them an extra-point to spend on a power or to acquire a new-skill.
    
# Combat
Tactical-battles against all-sorts of foes are often a corner-stone of role-playing games! Some games can focus on it nigh-exclusively while others save such-scenes for very-special occasions. In-general combat can be a fun-way to intercede or advance a story, the best combat-experiences focusing on mobility; planning; strategy; coordination; and having the freedom to approach them in many-different creative-ways and react to the expected and unexpected out-comes of these actions!

Combat in Minin is designed to be fast and short. Characters with high-brawl and combat-skills can be very-deadly; and even the weakest-foes can suddenly-become effective in larger-groups once they start gaining-momentum!

Miniatures; extra-dice; and a white-board can help visually-represent a battle-map and its characters for all-players!

The tone of combat needs-not necessarily be overtly-violent. A super-hero game can easily swap blood for *pows* and *bams*!

## Initiative
Especially when a battle starts (but also sometimes out of combat) it's easier to determine exactly in what-order each-character in a scene will act. This is done per-character by rolling a number of dice equal to their brain-score and adding the result, rerolling ties. Then characters act in-order from highest to lowest result. The narrator may-decide that similar-units act at-once, requiring a single-roll for a group of half-dozen rats rather than six individual-rolls.

As soon as the acting-order is defined each character takes his **turn**, a period of time in-which he can act, doing one single-action such as: attacking; moving; wielding or grabbing something; shouting an order… The entire-cycle from the first to last's character turns is called a **round**. Once a round ends, the next-one begins. Usually initiative-order is determined only-once per-scene but rerolling every-round can be a great-way to add tension and dynamism to a critical-scene!

Some battles start with one-side unaware of being-attacked! It could happen in an ambush or if that group is distracted... In such-cases a **surprised**-character cannot-act on the first-round of battle unless it passes a perception-test. Neutral out-comes mean the character cannot-act and failures will also make-him unable to defend, granting -1 or -2 to health-rolls!

## Attacks
Any weapon or armor has a -2 to +2 **quality**-value associated with-it. A typical leather-armor is a +0 item while a unique; legendary sword is +2; and a shabby-dagger is a -1-weapon. Prices go from 1-wealth for a -2-item to 5-wealth for a +2-one.

Brawl is used with Fight in close-range; Fire to shoot-missiles; and Sports to throw-objects at-distance. In case of success calculate the fatigue-points inflicted based on the quality of the attacker's weapon; and defender's armor; with an extra +1 for a success or +2 for a critical-success. All-attacks have the potential to deal at-least 1-fatigue regardless of modifiers.

Once the total-fatigue is calculated, the defender can **avoid** the damage-points by rolling a die per-point. Rolls equal or lower to their current-health cause 1 point to be avoided. At this-point the avoidance-rolls can eliminate all in-coming fatigue!

For-example a hero with a +1-sword versus a ruffian wearing a torn; -1 leather-armor will inflict 3 fatigue-points on a success. The 4-health ruffian rolls a die per fatigue-point; gets 2 and 4 and 6; 2 and 4 are below or equal 4; so he loses only 1-health.

A character that only-**defends** gains +1 to health-rolls until next-turn. **Aiming** grants +1 to attack the target next-turn.

## Fumbles
If an attack has a neutral result apply a fumble to the target; or to the attacker if he's rolled a critical-failure! Ideally players should creatively-describe the fumble and its-effects but they can also choose to roll two-dice and consult this table instead:
| Roll | Effect                                        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 12   | Stunned, cannot act next-turn                 |
| 11   | Falls, -1 penalty to all-actions              |
| 10   | Disarmed, drops a held or carried item        |
| 9    | Shaken, pass a brain-test or lose next action |
| 8    | Interacts with near-by enemy                  |
| 7    | Interacts with environment                    |
| 6    | Interacts with near-by ally                   |
| 5    | Dodge, target moves-away from attack          |
| 4    | Disabled, can-not act but can-move next-turn  |
| 3    | Pinned, can-not move but can-act next-turn    |
| 2    | Grapples, attacker and target grab each-other |
 
## Zones
A battle-field in Minim is usually divided in zones. A simple-example would be: front; middle; and back but it's usually more-interesting to uniquely-tailor uniquely to the specific-area (a night-club could have: an entrance; dance-floor; bar; lounge).

Moving between adjacent-zones takes a turn. Characters can only use close-combat attacks (like kicks and punches) for targets in their-zone. Firing projectiles or throwing objects to an adjacent-zone incurs a -1 penalty for the attack-test.

Area-effects (such as a storm-spell or a machine-gun salvo) affect all in a zone, whether they be friend; foe or neutral.

Areas such as a small-cave are only a single-zone. Even there characters can leave the zone by going to its very-edges. This allows enemies to be pushed-back and have to reenter the zone to attack; or for allies to dodge an incoming area-effect.

# Challenge
One of the hardest-tasks of being a narrator is trying to create a fun-adventure for the players (in-advance or during-play). Combat-encounters are especially-tricky to get-right because if a combat is too-hard it’s possible to out-right kill the players and end the game; but if it's too-easy it can feel trivial. These guide-lines can be used to help-with planning combat-scenes.

The **tier** indicates the value of the median character-traits. A character with every trait exactly at value 4 is considered to be tier-4. Each tier then  translates to a **challenge**-score:
| Tier | Challenge |
| ---- | ----------|
| 5    | 100       |
| 4    | 20        |
| 3    | 5         |
| 2    | 1         |
| 1    | 0.2       |

A typical player-character starting at tier-3 will have roughly 5-challenge. Find the total-challenge by adding individual-values: 2 tier-3 foes have a challenge of 10 (2 X 5); 5 tier-4 characters have a challenge of 100 (5 X 20); both-combined have 110.

The challenge lets you compare the players-group with an enemies-group to determine what are their odds of winning. A fifth  of the challenge is a moderate fight, while one with even half the challenge presents a chance of eliminating the player-group! Players have an edge due to being-able to rely on faith and items but bad-luck streaks of dice-rolls can also be gravely-lethal!

## Environmental-modifiers
Some combat-scenarios have special-mechanics that affect the battle-arena. For-example fighting on a crumbling-cave might cause rocks to fall from the ceiling and hurt the characters-below! This would be a neutral environmental-condition since rocks don't discriminate between friend or foe and need-not be taken into consideration when estimating-challenge.

Conditions that affect the players or the enemies more than the other-side though do-need to be taken into consideration when calculating-challenge. For-example a group that could prepare the room with traps and defenses before a fight begins surely will be much-harder to deal with than if the same group was caught in the middle of their sleep in a comfortable hotel-room! Each such-advantage will modify the group benefiting or suffering from-it as-much as-doubling or halving its challenge.

# Dungeons
The most-traditional RPG-adventure is the dungeon, an interesting-location that a group of player-characters can explore and conquer in any-way they choose during one or more game-sessions. Although the term dungeon implies dank; dark; under-ground complexes they can just as-well be a forest or sky-scraper as-long as there can be loosely-connected areas in-which players can find combat; rewards; traps; and interesting-features and characters to discover and interact-with!

Many-dungeons feature multiple-floors.  A **floor** is a dungeon-area containing a set of **rooms**, each-room representing a mostly self-contained location. The-deeper players go in a dungeon the-harder its challenges tend to be.

In Minim a guide-line to constructing dungeons is to take the player-group's total-challenge and spread that amount among the rooms of a dungeon-floor. This-way it becomes an increasingly-difficult task to clear all of it but the group can explore at their own-pace and leave when their resources are exhausted.

Dungeons are inherently-dangerous and dynamic locations! Roll a die if the players linger too-long in a room with a result of 1 causing an enemy-patrol or roaming-creature to find them! Like-wise if they leave and return-later roll-once per empty-room and on rolls of 1 add new-threats to these rooms, simulating empty-areas being-occupied while the players were-absent.

Don't forget to place rewards in the dungeon to incentivize-exploration and to help the group continue pushing on-ward! Magic-items are a great-choice, with one-item per-floor as a good base-line, its score equal to the player's median-tier.

## Creating floors
A typical-floor has 2 to 12 rooms; 1 to 6 combat-scenes; and 1 to 3 features. This list helps create features:
1. Mechanical or magical trap:
    1.  Guarding a reward
    2.  With hidden-reward
    3.  On a combat-room
    4.  One of the combats is an ambush
    5.  In an empty-room
    6.  Hidden in an empty-room
2.  Hidden-reward
3.  Brawl or brain test to access a room    
4.  A combat can be resolved with clever role-play; negotiation or other-wise peacefully
5.  A combat has environmental-modifiers
6.  One of the rooms holds a key that unlocks:
    1.  Hard-combat and great-rewards
    2.  Hard-combat and good-rewards
    3.  All of the floor's rewards
    4.  Mediocre-rewards
    5.  Poor-rewards
    6.  Access to other floor
