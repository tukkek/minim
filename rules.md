# Minim 
`Alex Henry, 2025-10-08`.

Minim is a role-playing game system that is simple to learn and play! RPGs are free; fun; and can be played by people of all-ages! They also promote problem-solving; creativity; team-work and story-telling, even being-used as an education-aide!

> Table-top role-playing games are a form of role-playing game (RPG) in which each person playing the game will make-believe that he or she is a character in the game. A person playing the game will tell the action of his character and a system of rules will tell whether the action can be done or not.
>
> The game will happen in a made-up world that is controlled by another person playing the game, called a game-master. The game-master tells the game's story to the players; tells them where they are in the game-world and plays the part of all the nonplayer-characters (NPCs) and foes that the players meet.

You can find more information; premade-scenarios; manuals; and other-products in many book-stores; libraries; and on-line!

The traditional quantity of players for a game-session is a narrator plus 2 to 4 players; and a session may last from a-couple to several-hours. Stories can be self-contained adventures for one-session; or years-long affairs featuring recurring player-characters!

# Why rules?
You may be wondering *this game seems more-like group story-telling, why should I bother with rules*? They come-in to prevent what-happens when children play: *I shoot you! No, you miss! No, I got you, you're dead! No, I'm not*!

Minim's rules also help the narrator prepare interesting; fair situations for his players. A game that is too easy or hard can quickly become unfun. Rules can't substitute a narrator who knows his-players best but they can surely help!

That being-said players don't need to constantly-rely on the rules! If the game goes-well with few-rules, that's fine and they are still-available for when they are required; are valuable; or can lead-to interesting-situations. Each game has its own sweet-spot!

The Golden-rule of RPGs states that the narrator always has the final-say on any-decision even if it contradicts the rules! Remember also that the game is meant to be fun for all-involved, whatever *fun* may mean for any particular player-group! 

# Philosophy
Minim is short for *minimalistic*. The system tries to be a very-simple game that can be-played using only common six-sided dice, ideally 2 per-player. Miniatures; extra-dice and drawing-paper or a white-board can be used but are entirely optional! The system is easy to learn as you read this short-book and new-rules are easy to create if they aren't described here.

Being simple, it's also easy to convert existing characters; adventures; worlds; and concepts to Minim or create new-ones, even mid-game if the narrator likes improvising! Many popular-systems require ample-preparation but Minim's is minimal.

To keep rules simple and short unfortunately some-realism has to be discarded. This doesn't mean that Minim is a casual-game though, combat can be highly-tactical and lethal especially when there are many-enemies against the players!

This is also a generic-system, which means that it supports all play-styles from swash-buckling pirate-adventures; to medieval-fantasy; or science-fiction worlds using the exact-same rules. You can even mix them a-bit if you'd like to try!

Minim's utmost-focus is to create fast-flowing narratives and rich game-play scenarios while balancing simplicity with realism.

# Tests
To determine the result of actions choose the most-relevant trait and skill. Apply +1 to the trait-score if the character has that skill or a -1 if he doesn’t, if there is no clear relevant-skill use only the trait (±0). This number will be the test’s **target**.

Now roll 2-dice and for-each determine the **partial-results** by examining each-roll:
- If the roll is a 1; or lower-than the target then you have a **success** (+1)
- If the dice roll is the-same as the target you have a **neutral** result (±0)
- Otherwise a 6; or a roll higher-than the target is a **failure** (-1)

Add the first and second partial-results to get the attempted action’s **out-come**. The possibilities are:
* **+2, critical-success**, the action surpasses-expectations, enhancing its benefits or achieving-them faster
* **+1, success**, the action achieves its intended-result
* **0, neutral**, partial-success or a slightly positive or negative result; unintended result; may-benefit the next-attempt...
**-1, failure**, no immediate-result but retrying is usually-possible
**-2, critical-failure**, the exact-opposite of the intended-result; disaster; danger; a total and final failure...

Examples:
* A warrior swings his-sword at an opponent. With 3-brawl and possessing the fight-skill the target is 4 (3 + 1). He rolls a 3 and a 4. 3 is less than 4 so it’s a success (+1); and 4 equals 4 so it’s neutral (±0). The out-come is +1, a success!
* Now an over-weight priest tries the same. His brawl is only 2 and he lacks the fight-skill so the target is 1 (2 - 1). He rolls 1 and 5. 5 is higher than 1 so it’s a failure (-1) but a natural-1 is an automatic-success (+1)! The out-come is neutral, 0 (1 - 1). The enemy wasn’t hit but perhaps moved-back to dodge, earning the priest just-enough time to escape to safety!

## Bonuses and penalties
Often you'll find that in-game circumstances will make actions easier or harder like trying to run with your legs tied-up! Bonuses and penalties can be:
- +2 to the target for big-advantages
- +1 to the target for small-advantages 
- -1 to the target for small-disadvantages
- -2 to the target for big-disadvantages
    
Multiple bonuses or penalties can-apply to an-action. Sum all applicable bonuses and penalties to get a final-modifier for the test. For-example a hero could be trying to strike a monster from the higher-ground (small-advantage); but his sword's tip is broken (small-disadvantage); and the monster is completely-unaware of his-presence (big-advantage).

In a calm environment characters gain a +1 bonus if taking twice as-long performing actions than they would usually-require.

Targets lower-than 1 only achieve successes with rolls of 1 (automatic-success); and 6 (automatic-failures) for targets over-5.

## Collaboration
Some-times many-characters can-attempt to perform the same-action. In this-case each makes their-own test. Usually they test the same trait-skill combination but those may-differ on certain-circumstances. Sum all-results to determine the action's out-come.

For-example a medic; a chemist; and a pathologist try to analyze a blood-sample. The medic tests brain-cure and adds +1; the chemist tests brain-knowledge with a +1 result; the pathologist tests brain-technology with a +0 result. The out-come is +2.

Out-comes higher-than +2 or lower-than -2 are bound to these limits. For very long-term projects like designing and building a drone the narrator may define a threshold like +100, with characters slowly-working to that goal over-time.

It's important to distinguish between a group performing actions individually versus performing one-action collaboratively. To hear a distant-sound all test brass-perception and those individual-tests determine who heard the sound or not; but if they are coordinating a house-search for evidence of a crime that is one-action with one out-come.

Collaboration usually needs coordination; planning; and discussion. This means that mostly only long-term actions can be collaborations even if there are rare-exceptions such-as pushing a boulder that is blocking a passage. Preparing a strong-argument to take to the ship's captain can be a collaborative-process but delivering it convincingly to him is an individual-action even if many can attempt-it.

# Characters
Each player-character starts with one-trait at 4, other at 3; and a last-one at 2. They can then acquire 3-skills of the highest-trait; 2-skills of the middle-one; and a skill of the lowest. They also distribute 3-points to powers.

Alternatively a player can choose to go-with 3 in all-traits; 2-skills per-trait; and 3 power-points.

These are normal starting-characters which are average-inhabitants of the game-world. Stronger or weaker player-characters can be made if the narrator so-chooses by applying a +1 or -1 to all-traits. Powers can also be similarly-adjusted, super-heroes like Bat-man and Superman would have dozens of power-points!

For narrator-characters he should-not be spending-points but rather assigning values and skills that properly-represent that character. A mighty-villain will naturally have more-points than the average-person; and animals like bugs and rats will have very-low values.

## Traits
Each character is defined by 3 traits, which are:
* **Brain** represents the intellectual-prowess of the character
* **Brawl** governs speed; dexterity; precision...
* **Brass** is the presence of a character, ranging from endurance; to mental-fortitude; charm...

These can have the following scores, with 2 to 4 being the normal-range for player-characters:
* 5, great
* 4, good
* 3, mid
* 2, bad
* 1, null

## Skills
Each-trait governs 5 skills. Brain-skills are:
* **Art**, creating things; painting; drawing; stone-work; jewelry; repairs; manufacturing; building; assembling; forgery...
* **Cure**, medicine; healing; first-aid...
* **Knowledge**, wisdom; learning; researching; remembering-facts...
* **Security**, lock-picking; burglary; arming and disarming traps and security systems and alarms...
* **Technology**, operating artifacts, from scrolls and magic-items in fantasy to computers and robots in science-fiction...

Brawl-skills:
* **Coordination**, fine motor-skills and manipulation of objects such as calligraphy or playing musical-instruments...
* **Fight**, fighting at close-quarters with a weapon or improvised-weapon or bare-handed; martial-arts; grappling...
* **Fire**, using missile-attacks at-range like a fire-arm or bow to hit a far-away target...
* **Sports**, athletics, acrobatics; balance; running; jumping; reaching; dancing; attacking by throwing objects...
* **Stealth**, moving and acting undetected

Brass-skills:
* **Coercion**, intimidation; bribery; street-smarts; banter...
* **Communication**, oratory; barter; socializing; discovering-rumors; detecting-lies...
* **Perception**, awareness; acuity; sight; smell; taste; hearing; touch...
* **Steering**, controlling a vehicle or vessel such as a horse; car; ship; plane; space-craft; giant-robot...
* **Survival**, interaction with beasts and critters; riding; farming; zoology; herbalism...

Optionally have each specialty cost 1-point like heart-surgery and psychotherapy (cure); fencing and karate (fight)...

## Health
Each-character starts at health equal to their brass-score and can never go above-it. Each-time a character is hurt or overly-exerted they receive **fatigue** points which are subtracted from the health-score. A character who loses all their health-points becomes **unconscious**. The dreaded **total party-kill** happens if all-players lose all their health then the game ends.

In some-games zero-health player-characters can become **disabled** instead, only-incapable of directly attacking or targetting others.

Health-points are fully-recovered when characters are able to relax for a-few minutes. Even characters mid-action may take a turn to regain their breath and restore a single fatigue-point if they roll equal-to or lower than their health.

Narrators running more realistic; serious; or gritty games can treat health less as fatigue and more as permanent-**damage**. In those-cases recovering a health-point requires long-term healing with a +1 for uninterrupted-rest in a given-period. A medic may also contribute his-own cure-test. An extremely-brassy character recovering from 4 points to 5 may only-need a good-night’s sleep but recovering from a debilitating near-death at 1 remaining health-point may require a year!

Health is not-only physical! In extreme-cases psychological and emotional **stress** can incur health-loss as fatigue-points! This is common for-example in horror-games in-which just glimpsing a terrifying; deadly monstrosity can shatter one's very-sanity!

## Faith
Each player-character starts with a number of faith-points equal to their brain-score and can never go above-that, representing a character's inner-strength reserves and his will-power. A point can be spent to **boost** any-action with a +1-bonus, only-once per-action.

Points are regained whenever a character acts according to their **virtue** or **vice**. These characteristics are determined at character-creation, one represents a good and productive quality; the other a negative and twisted personality-flaw. Narrators can award 1-point or a full-refill depending on game-style (fantasy-characters regain-faith faster; while they are a rare-resource in grim-dark settings)! A night's rest after a meal also grants 1 faith-point or 2 in a luxury-location with high-end amenities.

Faith-points give an-edge to player-characters. Narrator-characters never spend their faith for boosts.

In games that may-want to enable collaborative story-telling, blurring the line between players and narrator, faith-points can be used to dictate **fate**. A player can offer the narrator 1-point in exchange for an effect on the scene or story and if-accepted the point is spent and the effect occurs; like-wise a narrator may offer a point to a player to have his-character perform an action and if-agreed the player gains a faith-point. Narrators and players can always refuse-fate by simply refusing the transaction.

## Powers
Unlike skills there is no fixed-set of powers, each character or category (such as *dragons*) is expected to be unique and feature their-own. There is no-problem of-course in taking-inspiration from preexisting-powers like the Hadouken; Force-abilities; the Round-house Kick; or Fire-ball and Ultima spells then adapting-them to fit your-style! They don't need to be extraordinary either, powers like detecting-lies; fast reaction-times and leadership are mundane-abilities as-valuable as any magic-incantation!

Like traits the values for powers range from 1 to 5. Powers are activated by rolling a die. If the result is equal or lower than its power-score it is used at the cost of 1 faith-point; else the action is wasted.

There are two intrinsic-powers that all player-characters have, each starting at 1-point for-free:
* **Languages**. each-point grants fluency on a new-language and also a basic-familiarity with all-languages in its-group. For-example after spending 1-point to acquire German you’d also speak English and Dutch at a very-basic level.
* **Wealth** represents a character's finances. Scores grow-wealth exponentially with 1 being destitute-poor and 5 filthy-rich. Buying items requires a test with appropriate-modifiers (finding a painting in a big-city is not too-hard; but less-likely at a camping-site). Buying an item with a price equal to your wealth-rating spends all your points; items a step-below your wealth cost 1-point; while those even-lower cost-you nothing. Points can also be gained during-play if a character acquires valuable-assets!

As a guide-line for balancing: a power that targets a single-character should cause 2 points of fatigue; and those that affect all-targets in an area deal 1 point of fatigue. Instead of causing fatigue, powers can also prevent or cure 1 or 2 fatigue; grant ±1 or ±2 bonuses and penalties; or apply-conditions for 1-turn or 2-turns... Other social-based powers like contacts; allies; patrons... should-work more-like Wealth. Narrators are ultimetaly the arbiters of what is a fair or unfair power.

# Gear
Finding; buying; or crafting weapons; magic-wands; armor; tools... offers great game-play and resource-management opportunities for players and scales really-well over longer-periods as acquiring progressively-better gear over-time can be a fun and rewarding driving-force for many games! In-turn having better-gear allows tougher-challenges to be tackled, which often leads to better-rewards in a glorious-cycle of booty!

There are 2 types of gear, the first being **equipment**. These are weapons and armor with a **bonus** to be used in-combat. A dull and rusty dagger is a +1 weapon; a legendary and blessed sword of kings is +5. A heavy scale-mail is a +3 armor and it can be paired with a set of +1 leather-gloves for a +4 armor-bonus.

The second-type are **items** like Frodo's Light Of Aarendil or Harry Potter's invisibility-cloak which can be activated to create some-sort of effect. They also range from 1 to 5 **quality** and can be used either:
* Exactly like powers. Roll equal or-lower to spend a faith-point and activate the item.
* By reducing its quality by 1, which guarantees its effect occurs and destroying the item once it reaches 0-quality. Narrators may determine that some-items like grenades or potions can only be used this-way.

Narrators who want to avoid hoarding may establish that characters only have as-many gear-**slots** as their brass-score. This represents encumbrance and versatility (and magic-attunement in fantasy-settings). 

## Prices
This table shows prices for gears and goods. Player-characters can sell them for half the listed-price.
| Price | Gear bonus or quality | Fantasy-goods       | Modern-goods         | Science-fiction goods    |
| ----- | --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| $5    | +5-bonus or quality-5 | A castle            | An island or mansion | A space-station          |
| $4    | +4-bonus or quality-4 | A retinue of guards | A historical-relic   | A space-ship             |
| $3    | +3-bonus or quality-3 | A spell-book        | Brand-new truck      | Cybernetic-implant       |
| $2    | +2-bonus or quality-2 | A sword             | Rent in New York     | A laser-pistol           |
| $1    | +1-bonus or quality-1 | A torch             | Bus-fare             | A week-worth of food     |

## Resources
Keeping-track of finite-resources like meals is a great-way to add a layer of tension and strategy to a game! This choice is highly-dependent on genre: an action-heavy cyber-punk or modern-day urban-thriller would probably not-warrant the extra book-keeping even if it would make-sense occasionaly; but a Indiana Jones-style relic-hunt or survival in a post-apocalyptic world are great candidates for it!

Mundane-items like food; rope; light... are carried in a single-slot **happy-adventurer's kit**! When falling-back to a civilized-location the HAK generally regains its points, up to the full-amount of a character's brass; then while adventuring points are converted to resources and then consumed:
* When characters rest for the night convert a point to food and consume-it
* When a rope is needed convert a point and if the rope can be salvaged later regain it
* When light is required and a torch is burning roll a die every 10-minutes in-game and spend both a point and the light-source on a 1

A player who has no points or doesn't want to spend the ones they have will not be able to eat while resting (and thus not regain faith-points); find no rope in his bag; or be left in pitch-black darkness...

Many other mundane-resources can be tracked and spent using the HAK. Accessories for such-items are implied. A character carrying a modern torch-light will have the batteries to go with-it; a scribe who takes ink-vials to journal his quest also has pen and log-book...

These points can be shared by players. A high-brass character whose HAK is full of extra-rations cah help keep his mates well-fed!

Some actions and scenes can help regain a number of HAK points. Coming across an abandoned store-room might add 1 HAK-point to all characters if they can find some unspoiled-food. A survivalist may also regain-points with a survival-test by gathering berries packed with a large-leaf and vines to use as rope...

If the narrator allows, fate-points can also be used to find resources when reasonable. *The group is running low on light-sources but by sheer-luck come-across a broken table-leg; just-enough fabric and cooking-oil in the empty dining-hall for a make-shift torch*!

Players can spend wealth to buy resources aside the ever-repleneshing HAK. These cheap-resources are immediately-available and can be treated as commodities for any-character in a group with wealth 3 or higher. 

Narrators who want to enforce resource-management can rule that these bought-items occupy a gear-slot. Having a 5-day pack of iron-rations or an oil-lantern may be cheap and much-more convenient than relying on your HAK but now you may lack the bag-space to carry other cool-gadgets around!

Don't forget that time is also a most-important resource! If you don't want to track it precisely, you can roll a dice roughly every in-game hour and on a 1 advance the current-period (morning; day; evening; night and repeat).

# Combat
Tactical-battles against all-sorts of foes are often a corner-stone of role-playing games! Some games can focus on it nigh-exclusively while others save such-scenes for very-special occasions. In-general combat can be a fun-way to intercede or advance a story, the best combat-experiences focus on mobility; planning; ingenuity; coordination; and having the freedom to approach-them in many different and creative ways, reacting and adapting to the unpredictable out-comes of the player-characters and antagonists' actions!

Miniatures; extra-dice; and a white-board can help visually-represent a battle-map and its combatants!

Minin's combat is designed to be fast and short. Characters with high-brawl and combat-skills can be very-deadly; and even the weakest-foes can be-effective in larger-groups once they start gaining-momentum! 

Unlike other-systems just trying to attack every-turn can prove-innefective in Minim, especially in lower-tiers where neutral out-comes are more-common. Rather players are encouraged to exploit the environment around-them for bonuses they may-provide: jumping on tables for a high-ground advantage; forcing an enemy to fight on slippery-terrain to unsteady-them... Failing-that skilled-players create their-own advantages: surprise your enemies; grab their-attention with insults and bluffs to get-them to expose their flanks...

The tone of combat needs-not necessarily be overtly-violent. A super-hero game can easily swap blood for *pows* and *bams*!

## Initiative
Especially when a battle starts but also some-times out of combat it's easier to determine exactly in what-order each-character in a scene acts. This involves *rolling for initiative*, which means a character rolls as-many dice as their brain-score and totaling the result, rerolling ties. Similar-units can roll only-once rather than having to do-it a dozen times for a pack of rats.

As soon as the acting-order is defined each character takes his **turn**, a period of time in-which he can act, doing a-single **action** such as: attacking; moving; using a power or gear; wielding or grabbing an-item; shouting an order; interacting with the environment... The entire-cycle from first to-last character's turn is called a **round**. Once a round ends, the next-one begins.

Minim favors 2-methods for rolling-initiative:
* In **pop-corn style** only the highest-brain characters for each-group roll; once; for the first-round. The highest-roller acts-first then decides who goes-next; that character then acts and chooses who's-next; until all characters present in the scene have acted. Next-round, the same highest-roller starts-again. This is suggested as the ideal-way to roll as it reduces book-keeping and rewards clever passing of turns.
* **Full-initiative** is suggested for the most dangerous; dramatic; or extreme scenes. All-characters in-combat roll for initiative; every round; and act from highest to lowest rolls. This negates the more-casual nature of pop-corn initiative and creates unpredictable-dynamics every-round. This is meant-only for situations where every-single action can change the tide of combat for either-side of the conflict. Book-keeping can be extensive but in these scenarios it can actually-contribute to the tension in the air!

Some battles start with one-side unaware of being-attacked! It could happen in ambushes or if a group is distracted... In such-cases a **surprised**-character cannot-act on the first-round of battle unless it passes a perception-test. Neutral out-comes mean the character cannot-act and failures will also make-him unable to defend, granting -1 or -2 to avoid-rolls!

## Attacks
Any weapon or armor has a +1 to +5 **bonus**-value associated with-it. A typical leather-armor is a +2 equipment; while a rocket-launcher is +5; and a kitchen-knife is only +1.

Brawl is used with Fight in close-range; Fire to shoot-missiles; and Sports to throw-objects at-distance. In case of success calculate the fatigue-points inflicted based on the quality of the attacker's weapon; minus defender's armor; plus +1 for a success or +2 for a critical-success. This can't go below 1-fatigue.

Once the total-fatigue is calculated the defender can **avoid**-it by rolling a die per-point. Rolls equal or lower to their current-health cause 1-point to be avoided. Avoiding all of the fatigue is possible.

For-example a hero with a +3-sword versus a ruffian wearing a +2 leather-armor will inflict 3 fatigue-points on a critical-success (3 - 2 + 2). The 4-health ruffian rolls a die per fatigue-point; gets 2 and 4 and 6; 2 and 4 are below or-equal 4; so he avoids 2 fatigue-points and takes-1, going to 3 health (4 - 1).

Players can take actions such as these during their character-turns and are encouraged to be creative:
* **Defending** grants +1 to avoidance until next-turn
* **Aiming** gives +1 to attack one-target next-turn.

## Fumbles
If an attack has a neutral-result apply a fumble to the target; or to the attacker if he's rolled a critical-failure! Ideally players should creatively-describe the fumble and its-effects based on the circumstances but they can also choose to roll two-dice and consult this table instead:
| Roll | Effect                                        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 12   | Stunned, cannot act next-turn                 |
| 11   | Falls, -1 penalty to all-actions              |
| 10   | Disarmed, drops a held or carried item        |
| 9    | Shaken, pass a brain-test or lose next-action |
| 8    | Interacts with near-by enemy                  |
| 7    | Interacts with environment                    |
| 6    | Interacts with near-by ally                   |
| 5    | Dodge, target moves-away from attack          |
| 4    | Disabled, can-not act but can-move next-turn  |
| 3    | Pinned, can-not move but can-act next-turn    |
| 2    | Grapples, attacker and target grab each-other |

## Zones
A battle-field in Minim is usually divided in zones. A simple-example would be: front; middle; and back but it's usually more-interesting to uniquely-tailor zones to the specific-area (a night-club could have: an entrance; dance-floor; bar; lounge).

Moving between adjacent-zones takes an action. Characters can only use close-combat attacks (like kicks and punches) for targets in the zone they are in. Firing-projectiles or throwing-objects incur a -1 penalty for each-zone it has to enter.

Area-effects (such as a storm-spell or a machine-gun salvo) affect all in a zone, whether they be friend; foe or neutral.

Areas such as a small-cave are only a single-zone. Even-there characters can leave the zone by going to its edges. This allows enemies to be pushed-back and have to reenter the zone to attack; or for allies to dodge an incoming area-effect.

## Fleeing
At any-point a character can flee from-combat, this is done automatically once the **flee** action is taken. This has to make-sense in-game so prisioners fighting in a prison-cell have no-where to flee-to; nor can characters who are bound or prone or grappling escape before regaining the ability to do-so... 

Narrators may also determine that some enemies like a wolf-pack or a flying-dragon can't be fled as their speed is greater than the player-characters under normal-circumstances. In most-cases though enemies left-behind are likely to disengage and retreat to safety; go hunt for easier-prey; or reinforce the area...

Narrators are encouraged to let-players flee unless it breaks the in-game narrative. The ever-present peril of death is crucial in role-playing games, especially those that seek a harsher-feel but trivial-deaths that could-be avoided by simply walking-away are hardly fun or memorable. Characters will die in Minim but their deaths should be punishments for bad-choices or epic-struggles for bards to sing-about, not cheap.

There is a catch. Characters who are unconscious or disabled can-not flee. If other-characters run-away leaving a fallen-ally behind then most of the time this means that the character is now dead and beyond-salvation. In very-rare occasions the enemies may-choose to capture or enslave the fallen-character. Freeing-him should be a nigh-impossible task. If the first-combat turned-sour now the players have to fight-again in a better-defended area and with one-less ally on their-side, a suicidal last-resort.

This encourages players to flee-early when it's safer to do-so rather than waiting to the last-minute when things can go-bad and the consequences for fleeing are dire! Groups who accidently enter over-whelming straits they can-not win have the opportunity to flee but it will-not save-them from a series of bad-choices carried-out to its bitter-end; deciding to bolt only when the ship is flooded and half-way sunk!

# Advancement
Many Minim-games are one-shots, meaning that players (or the narrator) create their characters at the start of the game and once it ends the story is also-over. Other games though are **campaigns** creating a longer-story with the same-characters every-game, in this play-style it’s traditional for these characters to grow-stronger over-time by:
* At the end of a game-session the narrator asks players to vote on the coolest role-playing moment and the coolest in-game action, the session's **high-lights**. One faith-point is granted to each of those players, who may choose to keep them or award them to another player.
- **Horizontal-progress**. At the start of each-session players can fine-tune their characters if it is justified by recent; in-game events: relocate a single power-point to a new or existing-power; relocating a skill-point; changing their virtue or vice...
- **Gear** is by-far the most-common way characters increase in power! They're often consumed on-use or replaceable as better-gear is-found, making them the ideal-resources to frequently reward players with!
* **Reputation**: an entirely story-driven advancement-path encompassingg intangible rewards like titles; fame; ranks;... gaining-favor with strong-allies; making life-long friends; establishing a well-informed net-work of contacts... Many classic-campaigns saw characters go from being no-name wanderers to rulers of their-own feuds or kingdoms! Keep in-mind that as one gains-notoriety more-exposed they are to envy; jealousy; hatred; vitriol; betrayal... they also may accumulate a number of enemies and mistakes as-well!
- **Vertical-progress** happens at the end of a major story-arc, usually after a few or several adventures have-occurred and a mile-stone victory has been achieved. Discovering the villain’s secret-weakness may be an entire-story in it-self but usually only actually defeating-him ends the story-arc! To celebrate and reward-players the narrator may then grant-them a power; skill; or trait point for minor; middle; or major achievements.

To emulate a high-fantasy campaign; characters start at low-tier (-1 to all traits during creation) and then advance to mid; high; and epic tiers, each-time gaining all-of 3 power; 2 trait; 1 skill points! This leads to major-gains each-time and god-like heroes later-on so plan-ahead for memorable mile-stones!

# Challenge
One of the hardest-tasks of being a narrator is trying to create a fun-adventure for the players (in-advance or during-play). Combat-encounters are especially-tricky to get-right because if a combat is too-hard it’s possible to out-right kill the player-characters and end the game; but if it's too-easy it can feel trivial. These guide-lines can be used to help plan combat-scenes.

The **tier** indicates the value of the median character-traits. A character with every-trait exactly-at value 4 is considered to be tier-4. Each tier then translates to a **challenge**-score:
| Tier | Challenge | Description |
| ---- | ----------| ----------- |
| 5    | 100       | Epic-tier   |
| 4    | 20        | High-tier   |
| 3    | 5         | Mid-tier    |
| 2    | 1         | Low-tier    |
| 1    | 0.2       | Fodder      |

A typical player-character starting at tier-3 will have roughly 5-challenge. Find a group's total-challenge by adding individual-values: 2 tier-3 foes have a challenge of 10 (2 × 5); 5 tier-4 characters have a challenge of 100 (5 × 20); both-combined have 110.

The challenge lets you compare the player-group with an enemy-group to determine their-odds of winning. A fifth of the challenge is a moderate-fight, while one with even half the challenge presents a chance of eliminating the player-group! Players have an edge due to being-able to rely on faith-points and gear but bad-luck streaks with dice-rolls can also be gravely-lethal!

## Environmental-modifiers
Some combat-scenarios have special-mechanics that affect the battle-arena. For-example fighting on a crumbling-cave might cause rocks to fall from the ceiling and hurt the characters-below! This would be a neutral environmental-condition since rocks don't discriminate between friend or foe and need-not factor when estimating-challenge.

Conditions that affect the players or the enemies more than the other-side though do-need to be taken in consideration when calculating-challenge. For-example a group that could prepare the room with traps and defenses before a fight begins surely will be much-harder to deal with than if the same group was caught sleeping in a comfortable hotel-room! Each such-advantage will modify the group benefiting or suffering from-it as-much as doubling or halving its challenge.

# Dungeons
The most-traditional RPG-adventure is the dungeon, an interesting-location that a group of player-characters can explore and conquer in any-way they choose during one or more game-sessions. Although the term dungeon implies dank; dark; under-ground complexes they can just as-well be a forest or sky-scraper as-long as there can be loosely-connected areas in-which players can find combat; rewards; traps; and interesting-features and characters to discover and interact-with!

Many-dungeons feature multiple-floors.  A **floor** is a dungeon-area containing a set of **rooms**, each-room representing a mostly self-contained location. The-deeper players go in a dungeon the-harder its challenges tend to be.

In Minim a guide-line to constructing dungeons is to take the player-group's total-challenge and spread that amount among the rooms of a dungeon-floor. This-way it becomes an increasingly-difficult task to clear all of it but the group can explore at their own-pace and leave when their resources are exhausted.

Dungeons are inherently dangerous and dynamic locations! Roll a die if the players linger too-long in a room with a result of 1 causing an enemy-patrol or roaming-creature to find them! Like-wise if they leave and return-later roll-once per empty-room and on rolls of 1 add new-threats to these rooms, simulating empty-areas being-occupied while the players were-absent. 

Tables from-which premade enemy-groups can be pulled from are often used for these **random-encounters**. These can be sorted with the most-dangerous groups on-top; so that 2-dice can be rolled; picking the lowest-value. This allows a wide-range of difficulties in the tables, which adds tension and risks for lingering in a place as-hostile as a dungeon; while still favoring the players most of the time.

Don't forget to place rewards in the dungeon to incentivize-exploration and to help the group continue moving-on! For gear a good base-line is one-item per-floor, its score equal to the player's median-tier.

## Creating floors
A typical-floor has 2 to 12 rooms; 1 to 6 combat-scenes; and 1 to 3 features. This list helps create features:
1. Mechanical or magical trap:
    1.  Guarding a reward
    2.  With hidden-reward
    3.  On a combat-room
    4.  One of the combats is an ambush
    5.  In an empty-room
    6.  Hidden in an empty-room
2.  Hidden-reward
3.  Brawl or brain test to access a room
4.  A combat can be resolved with clever role-play; negotiation or other-wise peacefully
5.  A combat has environmental-modifiers
6.  One of the rooms holds a key that unlocks:
    1.  Hard-combat and great-rewards
    2.  Hard-combat and good-rewards
    3.  All of the floor's rewards
    4.  Mediocre-rewards
    5.  Poor-rewards
    6.  Access to other floor
